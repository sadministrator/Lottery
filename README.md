# Nervos Hackathon
## Broaden the Spectrum

This repository contains a smart contract and it's deployment code for the [nervos hackathon challenge: Port an Existing Ethereum dApp to Polyjuice](https://gitcoin.co/issue/nervosnetwork/grants/8/100026214).

The smart contract is an upgrade to solidity 0.8 of the contract Lottery.sol, which I found in https://github.com/sadministrator/Lottery but actually is much older.

The deployment code is gracefully taken from https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/examples/2-deploy-contract ;)
